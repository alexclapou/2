distr_namernd(par, m, n) = generates m x n matrix of random numbers that follow the distribution distr_name
ex: exprnd, trand

U(0,1)=>rand
N(0,1)=>randn

2a)
bern(p), pe(0,1), x(   0  1)
                   (  1-p p)

possible steps to solve 2a)
+ask for p
+ask for N(number of simulations)
+generate a vector of observations that is U(filled with N random numbers from U(0,1))
+define the random variable X just as we did
-list the values in X only once using unique command
-how many times each value appears in X using command list
-transform the relative frequencies into probabilities(number of times of app divided by number of simulations

possible step to solve 2b)
-ask for number of trials
-ask for probability
-ask for number of simulations
